Email from Admin - Jim McGowan
At 3:30 PM, today, Yvette Maxie was asked to reach out the local municipality. Her conversations revealed that authorities did not seem overly concerned about the situation. In addition, it was suggested that work by a private contractor may have contributed to the flooding.

Responders have stated that as many as 16 homes may be affected, however, calculations suggest that not more than 50 people (the threshold for opening a shelter), maximum, would be displaced.

Due to the fact that only a single family is requesting help and the likelihood that there will no immediate resolution to the flooding in the Client's home, Responders have been asked to do the following:

1. Request that the client contact her local municipality and alert them to the problem;

2. Determine specifically what the client is requesting and provide reasonable assistance to the two persons affected.

We will continue to monitor the incident and act accordingly should the situation worsen or additional clients contact us seeking help.

(Staff Back-Up Beverly Wright-Thames is in the loop with this situation)

There were 5 adults and 2 children displaced.  However, they have State Farm insurance; which are on the way to clients right now, and will be putting them up in hotel room and covering everything.  There is one client (Samira Shawer @ 708-928-9146) that will need meds replaced.  Bernie indicated State Farm would also handle this for the client, however, there may be a need for Red Cross to assist with this if client finds out differently once State Farm arrives.  

Received call from Amess (son of Samira Shawer). He stated that State Farm insurance informed them they would not be able to assist them with their losses because of lapse in payment for their coverage; which would not cover this incident. I asked what type of assistance they are asking for from us. He indicated food and clothing.

Called Bernie back to run this past him. He stated that the client was extremely confident when he told Bernie that they have insurance and everything is going to be taken care of. I told Bernie about the clients request for food and clothing. He stated that when he was on-scene with the client: He had 2 large suitcases that they were ready to leave with once the State Farm person arrives. So, this could be potentially a 'double dipper.' Will run past SBU.

Bernie called back again. He stated that when he was on-scene with Amess (client's son), he stated they had already contacted State Farm and had a claim number, and were about to be in transit to a hotel and had housing. Bernie stated with his experience (also has a friend that works for State Farm), if the payment had lapsed and there was no coverage, they wouldn't have been issued a claim number.

Tried calling client (Amess) back at contact number 708-928-9146, but got voicemail box. Left a message indicating that we will need to obtain his claim number with State Farm and contact them ourselves to validate his story before ARC will take further action on this. However, I am contacting Health Services for RX replacement since Bernie reiterated that client originally stated State Farm may not cover the meds.

The 'delegate' of the client cleared by Staff Back-Ups (Emily & Roxy)... Since client (Wilbert Kellogg) is in hospital, a LaDonna Burmley is authorized to receive a CAC card for food only, because LaDonna stated she was not told she would have to be on-scene to receive the CAC Card. I spoke with LaDonna directly; with her financial assistance concern predominantly being getting a new bed for Wilbert (furniture). LaDonna indicated she had previously spoken with our casework desk when I explained about providing her with referrals for that. However, per our responders (Lazenia) after damage assessment: We will be providing food assistance, and I explained to LaDonna she would have to call us back to make an appt to pick up the CAC for food at her convenience from Rauner (as she's not available, and CAC form has to be signed directly from her). So it was concluded amongst us (Responders Lazenia & Brooke, SBU, & Dispatch) that LaDonna can call dispatch back to let us know when she wants to come to Rauner to pick up the CAC card for the client for just food assistance. Communicated this back to the LaDonna and provided her with incident number for reference.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,50,10/20/2014 7:27,10/20/2014 7:28,10/20/2014 7:38,10/20/2014 7:55,10/20/2014 8:20

Called Stanley Elmore at the request of Michelle McSweeney. He left a voicemail for her while she was out of the office on 1/15/15, and was requesting clothing assistance. Spoke with Stanley Elmore and referred him to Catholic Charities and Salvation Army.

REVISION - 01/13/15
See 15-1354 for further documentation:
""Stanley Elmore called to report the fire and stated that this home is owned by his mother. He also said that he hasn't been to the house yet because he's staying elsewhere and heard about it on the news / via his sister. When the incident was verified with Chris at Operations he indicated that the notes state that the home was vacant and that there were squatters in the home at the time. Mr. Elmore was called back and advised that the Red Cross cannot provide services at this time due to the fact that the home was classified as vacant.""

Spoke with Lazenia Adams (708-203-6694) and she indicated that on second thought the house did look vacant to her.  She obtained the name above (Stanley's mother) from mail that was strewn on the sofa.

Per Emily Krettler (SBU) and Lazenia Adams, this house is considered vacant, no persons were displaced and services are not available.

Received approximately six calls from this man claiming his name is Derwin Elmore and that he was in the hospital when his home burned. He says he is in immediate need of food clothing and shelter. I took his information, not realizing what had already occurred with this person earlier today, and said I would call him back. I then spoke with Staff Backup- Emily, and previous dispatcher, and the client has now lied about his name and what the circumstances were. He called me back at approximately 13:40, and I kindly but very firmly told him that his is not eligible for any services, and the he needs to stop calling this number. Since then he has called 4 more times, all of which I did NOT answer.

Heavy, black smoke is billowing from a train derailment about three miles south of Galena.  It happened near the Galena river, south of Ferry Landing Road.

The BNSF train derailed around 1:20 this afternoon, according to Michael Trevino, a rail official.  The train was carrying 105 loaded cars. Of those, 103 of them were carrying crude oil.

Galena City Administrator Mark Moran said there have been no evacuations ordered because the area where this happened is very remote.  No injuries have been reported either.  Moran said the train employees were accounted for and fine.

Moran said around a dozen first responders from Galena and the surrounding counties first arrived at the scene to take stock of what happened.

""There are 8 tanker cars that are off the track,"" said Moran.  ""Two of those are still standing upright.  Six of them are not and are either on their side or upside down.  One of those cars is smoking.""

Moran said due to the volatile situation, the crews were ordered to pull back and head to the incident command center off Highway 20.  Then, once BNSF took over the investigation, Moran said the Galena first responders were called off the incident.

The boiler in the basement overheated and caught fire which resulted in the heat being shut off in all units as well as the electric and gas.  The fire was contained to the boiler only.  After talking with the Police Officer on scene, it appears to be a tenant/landlord issue in that the LL temporarily fixes problem quite often.

Also, educated the Renter's about not using their stove/oven as a heating tool since several tenants were doing.  A few renters did not know the risks and advised them to stay with family/friends until the boiler has been repaired.

This fire originally occurred on 6/9. We sent responders who met with clients on scene - both families had insurance and declined services - see clients tab.

On 6/11 we received a call from National relaying client Dariyous Brown to us. He claims to have been involved in this fire and is requesting assistance. We did not realize at the time that we had already sent responders to this scene, so we re-deployed a DAT team for an exterior DA to try to determine what assistance Dariyous would qualify for. Dariyous stated that he was in the process of being evicted, but that his belongings were still in the building. External DA confirmed windows out and fire - but building was boarded up and there was no way to determine the extent of the damage on first floor. Dariyous was afraid to meet responders on scene and had somewhere to stay tonight, so he was instructed to call Rauner on 6/12 to schedule an appointment for assistance based on DA.

After sending additional responders to scene, original responder Amanda called dispatch to relay that this case was already in DCSOps. Original responders did not do an internal DA while they were on scene and stated that they were unaware of a third party and thought they had spoken with everyone involved in fire. 

Talked to SBU Kaleena, at this time because client was in the process of eviction, has been staying elsewhere (possibly with Aunt), and should have clothing with him, client will only qualify for soft services because immediate needs are covered.

In response to flooding occurring along the Illinois River, we will be opening a shelter at the Salvation Army at 516 W Madison St in Ottawa to assist with the evacuation of Marseilles and Utica.  The shelter will be managed in partnership with the Salvation Army.  Historical models lead us to believe that 50 clients or less will be seeking shelter.  However, we should be able to support additional folks if needed.  At the time we will be providing the cots, blankets and food. Joyce Cook, Mark Gephardt and Steve Swett are already active on the response and will be assisting with the initial standup of the shelter.  Mark Gephardt and Emily Krettler will continue to support our liaising with the LaSalle EMA.  

Whiteside County
Also at this time we are continuing to support the distribution of water in Rock Falls (Whiteside County).  This is following the suspension of water supply in the city due to flood-related contamination.  It is unclear when the water service will resume but we anticipate it occurring sometime tomorrow.  7 volunteers have been active throughout the day in supporting multiple distribution points in partnership with the City of Rock Falls.  All of the water has been donated in-kind by Wal-Mart and Kroger.  Later this afternoon and evening we will be delivering cases of water directly to 3 assisted-living facilities in the city.  Leslie Mastroianni is at the EOC in Rock Falls supporting the operation and Mike O’Brien is overseeing the distribution efforts.

Possible Escalation
In addition to the responses listed above, we have also received over 10 flood calls from around the region since this time yesterday.  While these are the current needs that we are aware of, there is the potential of flooding as rainwaters continue to flow downstream.  We may see additional response needs, including sheltering, develop over the next 48 hours as rivers rise further and more rainfall takes place.  Further messaging will come out later today to the full DCS team as the strategy for a potential escalation is developed.

SUMMARY: 
Fire occurred around 0230 on 11/23/16; displacing a total of 81 people residing in 39 units at 5 Times Square Rd in Elgin, IL. 

Red Cross dispatch received notification of incident around 0745 on 11/23/16. Responders were then dispatched to the apartment complex and later opened a casework reception center at the Hemmens Cultural Center, located at 45 Symphony Drive in Elgin, IL. 

18 families received services at the center (35 adults and 13 children) with a sign posted directing additional requests to contact our dispatch line to schedule an appointment to meet with responders over the holiday weekend. See clients tab for details on families served on scene and placeholders for families that expressed a need for services, but missed the team on 11/23/16. Immediate DCA can be provided to the residents of building 5 through 11/30/16 should anyone call requesting help. See the tenant list in the attachments tab for full names of building residents. 

Building is uninhabitable due to electricity and heat being turned off after the fire. To turn on utilities, inspections must be completed by the Fire Marshal and the City of Elgin's building department. See timeline for next steps with Fire Marshal inspection. 

Many residents are Spanish speaking, have access or functional needs or are from a lower socio-economic status. Full family details and outstanding needs are located in client records in CAS. 

Given the Thanksgiving holiday and upcoming weekend, it was estimated by the Building Management company that the soonest residents would be able to re enter the building would be Monday, 11/28/16. 

Responders to the scene and casework center provided DCA plus lodging to the families impacted by this incident. Additional follow up work will be completed by the casework and recovery team.",1,0,2,36,0,0,0,42,19,22,14345,11/23/2016 13:47,11/23/2016 13:48,11/23/2016 14:07,11/23/2016 14:55,11/24/2016 3:18

The property management company provided hotel stays for the first three days following the fire but were unable to continue that support and the building remained inaccessible due to the fire.

On Monday, a team of five Red Crossers opened a small reception center and provided lodging assistance for the displaced individuals. Throughout the week, we continued to work with the management company to determine when the clients would be able to return to their homes and if any other resources were available. Yesterday we learned that repairs on the building were taking longer than expected and that the majority of clients would be unable to return until early next week. Based on this, a determination was made to provide supplemental assistance to those who were running out of funds to continue staying at the hotel until they’re homes were repaired.

Situation Summary:
At approximately 1:30AM this morning, we were notified by social media of a fire in a 52-unit apartment building on Woodcreek Dr in Bolingbrook. Initially, it was not known if Red Cross services were needed, however, shortly after 2:30AM, responders were requested. By 4:30AM, it was determined that at least 16 units had been affected. 

Our teams have been on the scene at a Reception Center opened in the River Stone Apartments clubhouse meeting with and assisting those affected. Apartment management has vacant units which they have allocated to 14 families. As the units are unfurnished, the Red Cross has provided cots, blankets and comfort items.
 
Thirty-eight additional families have displaced: two by fire damage, the rest due to utilities being shut off. As a result, we have opened a shelter at Bolingbrook High School located at 365 Raider Way.
 
We have staff available to assist through the night to support this operation. Wilson Chow will be the Shelter Manager this evening and will transition to Judy Gustafson who will cover overnight operations. The shelter opening has been recorded in NSS. The shelter will remain open until 8AM tomorrow. Building management will utilize their resources to provide additional sheltering/feeding assistance to the 38 families. Except for the 16 impacted families, there is no anticipation that further casework assistance will be needed.

It is with regret that we advise that a 24-year-old man passed away as a result of the fire.

No family or relatives were on site, consequently ARC responders spoke to neighbors to collect contact information.

The deceased was living alone at the time with his mother and father out of town. Responders left a door hanger at the incident and will follow up as per SOP.

DLOC will request:
--- DHS to assess if funeral assistance required
--- Region Preparedness Manager to assess if this home had been visited during  the recent June 2018 Sound the Alarm rally that focused on this neighborhood

Due to intial OEMC feedback and concerns that the incident was a potential criminal investigation, and that no family were at the scene we purposefully held back responding until facts were established later in the day.

Media reported the following:

""A man and a dog were found dead Friday morning after a kitchen fire in a South Side Gresham neighborhood home, officials said. A family member found the 24-year-old man dead shortly after 10:30 a.m. inside the home in the 8600 block of South Honore, according to Fire Media Affairs director Larry Langford. The fire apparently started when the man fell asleep while food was cooking in the kitchen, Langford said. It burned itself out at some point before the man was discovered. 

The fire generated “heavy smoke and carbon monoxide” inside the home, according to the fire department. The relative had gone to the house to check on the man and found him dead near a dog, which was also dead, Langford said. Preliminary investigation indicated the man may have woken up at some point and tried to get the dog out of the home, but was unable to make it out. 

The Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office had not released details about the death as of Friday afternoon. It was not immediately clear what time the fire occurred, but it may have started between 10 p.m. Thursday and sometime Friday morning, according to Langford. Smoke detectors were present and working in the house. The fire remained under investigation.""

The Rockford Fire Department requested ARC responded to a house fire in the 700 block of Winnebago Street around 5:45 this morning. 

Flames were showing from the second floor of the home. Fire crews searched the house after reports of a two year old child in the building, with an active search and rescue taking place.

Firefighters were able to find and rescue the child, who was taken to the hospital in critical condition. The child later died as a result of their injuries.

It was determined that the clients could be best served by coming to the ARC Chapter office where their privacy and needs could be better met.

The ARC commenced provided services (non-livable and lodging) totalling $1,465 for the eight surviving family members. Comfort kits and colouring books for the children were also offered.
